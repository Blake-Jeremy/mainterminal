This package will fake your activity by printing random messages into the Terminal and make it look like you're compiling, installing or debugging some important stuff at work.

## Here's what it looks like?

## Tweaked version of marvelefe/lazyterminal

Forked to replace the word lazy, because it shows up in the title of the terminal/cmd window.

## Future mod ideas

- Quiet flag, or default selection after timeout (ain't nobody got time for entering text).
- Minimize script condescension (maybe having a chatty screen is a good thing).
- Add some "oooooo......" status lines, I really miss that style of console output from the ages ago.
- I really like some of the ideas from tsouanas/lookbusy.

## How to use?

Dependencies:
Node.js

- Stage files in folder mainterminal somewhere on local drive (ex: C:\temp\mainterminal)
- Open CMD prompt
- Change to parent directory (ex: C:\temp)
- Run the following

```
cd mainterminal && npm i && npm run mainterminal
```
